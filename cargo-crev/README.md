# `cargo-crev` - Cargo Code REView!

## Introduction

[Crev](https://github.com/dpc/crev/) is a language and ecosystem agnostic,
distributed Code REView system.

`cargo-crev` is a CLI implementation/frontend of Crev integrated with `cargo` and targeting
Rust/crates.io ecosystem.

`cargo-crev` is a tool helping Rust users evalute quality and trustworthiness
of dependencies they use.

## How it works

* Identify your dependencies: list in many useful ways.
* Review crates: judge their safety, quality and document problems.
* Publish verifiable reviews in a public git repository.
* People download your reviews, you download reviews of others.
* Build a web of trust veting whole Rust ecosystem.
* Gain reputation and trust. Maybe even monetize it, by reving code for money.
* Implement it in your company and/or team to stay ahead!
* Never again get bitten by unreviewed and untrusted code.

## Getting started

Static binaries are availble on [crev's releases](https://github.com/dpc/crev/releases) page.

Follow the [`cargo-crev` - Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/dpc/crev/blob/master/cargo-crev/src/doc/getting_started.md)
(more documentation available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cargo-crev)).

`cargo-crev` is a work in progress, but it should be usable at all times.
